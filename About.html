        <p>
            Higherarchy takes a holistic approach to cannabis. Like a farm-to-table restaurant, Higherarchy grows custom
            strains of cannabis plants used in a propriety line of edibles, prerolls, and body products. No part of the
            plant goes to waste, and Higherarchy controls the entire process, including farming, harvesting, ingredient
            selection, and production.
        </p>

        <p>

            Higherarchy artisanal cannabis products cater to recreational and medicinal consumers alike, specializing in
            THC and CBD options for all lifestyles. Higherarchy's edible line includes sugar-free, gluten-free, and
            vegan options, ensuring something for all.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to the specialized line of products, Higherarchy is community-focused and places people and
            planet before profit. Looking to right injustices of the past, Higherarchy will employ people with cannabis
            and drug-related convictions and offers apprenticeship opportunities to those who would like to enter the
            industry. Higherarchy also plans on donating products to communities in need ensuring that price is not a
            barrier to cannabis medicinals. With a focus on social justice and veteran services, Higherarchy will
            support various charitable endeavors and set a standard on what a local cannabis business can contribute to
            the communities they serve.
        </p>

        <p>
            The planet is also important to Higherarchy. Sustainable packaging, conscious energy usage, and many other
            sustainability initiatives will be at the forefront of Higherarchy's business model.
        </p>

        <p>
            Higherarchy is a family-owned business founded by Trimell Hawkins, Eliah Hawkins, Michael Hall, and Jermaine
            Hall. Higherarchy is also a black and veteran owned business and would like to thank Trimell for his service
            in the Marines and Michael and Jermaine for their service in the Army.

        </p>
        <p>
            Higherarchy is a new standard in excellence!
